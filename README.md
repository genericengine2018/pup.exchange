This repository contains source files for the eos project pup.exchange.

Follow eosio instructions to compile them into a contract and verify it with the one deployed on the eos account puppycore124.

By open sourcing the core code and having the core account immutablized, this projects reaches the highest level of security that a decentralized application could reach in theory, because the code is now fixed and will be reviewed by everyone.

Feel free to utilize the code in your projects or develop your products on top of the service provided by puppycore124.


#updated 2020/11/12
Mining module has been successfully seperated from the wrapper account. The code has been added to this repository. The account that runs the mining code is named puppymineral on EOS, which is scheduled to be immutablized by the end of November.

Now almost all PUP token supply is locked up in the mining module for fair distribution, which makes this project even more decentralized than ever.
